"""Provider capability and specialist workflow matrix (issue #779, epic #753).

Data-only module. The provider inventory table is rendered straight from
``seohead.data_sources.providers.provider_registry()``, so it can never drift
ahead of the declared registry. The workflow rows are a finite curated
catalogue whose command and provider references are kept honest by
``tests/test_provider_matrix.py`` — the same boundary pattern as
``seohead/input_contracts.py`` — rather than by importing the interface layers
at runtime.

Two distinctions the matrix exists to keep visible:

- ``declared`` is not ``verified``. A provider listed in the registry is a
  declared contract; a present credential is configuration state. Only an
  explicit ``provider-verify`` read that returns ``target_access=verified``
  proves live access, and this document asserts none.
- ``registered operation`` is not ``shipped surface``. An operation the
  registry declares but no handler or collection dispatch reaches stays
  ``unsupported`` here, by name.

Provider identity is typed, not a bare name, because the same vendor reaches
the code through different routes. ``registry`` references are ids in
``provider_registry()`` reached through ``provider-verify`` /
``provider-collect``; ``dedicated`` references are integration modules the
handlers call directly, bypassing the registry dispatch
(``keywords-expand``/``keywords-seasonality``/``regions-tree``/``serp-fetch``
reach ``seohead.data_sources.yandex_cloud``, ``keywords-exact`` reaches
``seohead.data_sources.arsenkin``, ``indexnow-submit`` reaches
``seohead.data_sources.indexnow``, ``topvisor-read`` reaches
``seohead.data_sources.topvisor``, and ``google-keywords``/``google-serp``
reach ``seohead.data_sources.dataforseo`` — none of which is the
``dataforseo_backlinks`` registry entry); ``local`` references are in-process
tools with no provider transport at all; ``declared`` references name a
registry contract no shipped route reaches, so they mark declared — never
shipped — surface.
