"""Find near-duplicate pages with SimHash and locality-sensitive hashing (LSH).

Large websites often contain tens or hundreds of thin or duplicated pages caused
by faceted pagination, copied content, and utility routes. Comparing every pair
is O(n²): 10,000 pages require roughly 50 million comparisons. SimHash plus LSH
reduces that workload by mapping each page to a 64-bit fingerprint, placing likely
matches in shared bands, and comparing only candidates from a common band.

The implementation uses Charikar's SimHash algorithm:
  1. Text is tokenized into overlapping k-shingles (k=3 by default).
  2. Each shingle is mapped to a deterministic 64-bit FNV-1a hash.
  3. For each bit, the hashes contribute +1 or -1; a positive sum sets that bit in
     the document fingerprint.
  4. Fingerprint similarity is ``1 - (Hamming distance / 64)``.

Every real site is templated: most of any page's text is shared chrome that
survived content-area scoping (see ``content_area.py``) — a repeated CTA, a
disclaimer, a related-items rail. Left alone, that shared text dominates step 3's
majority vote on every document, so the whole corpus converges on nearly the same
fingerprint regardless of how different each page's own content actually is, and
every LSH band collides into one bucket instead of pruning anything (issue #162).
Once a corpus is large enough for the statistic to mean something
(``_MIN_DOCS_FOR_TEMPLATE_FILTER``), ``find_duplicates`` first finds shingles that
occur in nearly every document (``_TEMPLATE_DOC_FREQ_RATIO``) and zeroes their
vote before hashing: they carry no information about which documents are alike,
so they should not get to decide the fingerprint. Below that corpus size no
shingle is discounted, because two or three documents legitimately sharing "all"
of their shingles is exactly the near-duplicate case this tool exists to catch,
not a template.

For candidate retrieval, LSH divides the (template-damped) 64-bit fingerprint
into fixed-width bands. Two documents become candidates when at least one band
matches, and the exact Hamming similarity must still meet the configured
threshold before an edge joins them. That per-edge check alone does not make a
valid cluster: chaining A-B and B-C edges connects A and C by transitivity even
when A and C were never compared and do not meet the threshold together (issue
#161). So each connected component is re-verified afterward and, if it is not
already a clique, split into complete-linkage subgroups — every member pair
inside a reported cluster, not just the edges LSH happened to follow, is
guaranteed to meet ``threshold``.

Exact duplicates (identical text) are found separately, by hashing each
document's text with SHA-1. A cluster whose members are all exact duplicates
of one another is reported only under ``exact_duplicates``, never under
``clusters`` — otherwise a byte-identical pair would be reported twice, once
as "exact" and once as its own trivial "near" cluster at similarity 1.0.
Hashing the caller-supplied text (rather than raw response bytes) is what
makes the comparison survive a page-unique CSRF token or timestamp: the text
extractor is expected to have already stripped markup and, ideally, scoped
itself to the page's content area (see ``content_area.py``).

Both exact and near comparisons default to indexable pages only — a page
canonicalised to another is an intended twin, not a defect — via the
``indexable`` flag on each item and the ``only_indexable`` parameter.

This module is pure and performs no network access. The caller supplies page text
from a Screaming Frog crawl, live ``parse`` calls, or another audit data source.
Because it is pure, re-running with a new threshold against a stored corpus
costs no requests.
