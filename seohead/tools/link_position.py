"""Classify a link by where it sits in the page: nav, header, sidebar, footer, or content.

A link's ancestor chain says more about it than its href does: a broken link
repeated in a global footer is one template fix, and a page linked only from
that footer is not linked the way a page linked from body copy is. Neither
fact is visible from the URL list alone.

Classification is ordered rules over the link's own ancestor path, tested with
``soupsieve.closest`` (the same matcher BeautifulSoup's ``.select`` uses under
the hood) rather than a hand-rolled ancestor walk. The built-in rules cover
``<nav>``/``<header>``/``<aside>``/``<footer>`` and their common ARIA-role and
class-name equivalents; site-specific rules are expected on top, because
plenty of menus are not a ``<nav>`` element at all. Rules are tried in order
and the first match wins, which is what "site-specific rules run first" means
in practice: a caller can prepend a rule that reclassifies a specific block
before the built-ins ever see it.

The last bucket, "content", is deliberately not one more selector on the same
list. It reuses ``content_area.find_content_root`` -- the same notion of
"where the content is" that word counts and duplicate detection already use --
by identity: a link is "content" when it descends from that resolved root and
matched no boilerplate rule first. This module never invents a second
definition of content.
