"""Where this toolkit stands against the field's published issue catalogue.

Screaming Frog publishes a list of the issues its crawler reports — 320 across 24 categories.
It is the closest thing technical SEO has to a shared checklist, so it is the honest yardstick
for "what does this find". Without it, "118 checks" is a number with nothing to compare to.

**Only the issue names are used here.** They are the field's shared vocabulary for these
problems — "Redirect Chain", "Missing Alt Text", "Orphan URLs" — and naming a problem is not
copying a description of it. Every explanation in this module is written about *our own*
behaviour: what we find, what we find only partly, what we do not find, and what we have
decided not to find. Nothing is reproduced from that page.

Each entry carries exactly one status:

``check``         a registry check finds it; ``refs`` names the check ids.
``tool``          a command outside the crawl registry finds it; ``refs`` names the commands.
``partial``       we find part of it. ``note`` says which part we miss.
``gap``           we should find it and do not. ``note`` says what is missing.
``out_of_scope``  we will not, and ``note`` says why it is a decision rather than an oversight.

``tests/test_sf_issue_map.py`` asserts every referenced check id and command still exists, so a
rename breaks the build instead of quietly making this document wrong.
