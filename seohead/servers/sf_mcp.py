# FastMCP calls a plain ``def`` tool synchronously on the server's single asyncio
# event loop (mcp.server.fastmcp.tools.base -- there is no thread hop for a sync
# function), so a live crawl mode's blocking subprocess wait used to freeze the
# whole stdio server: no other request could be served, and a client's
# CancelledNotification had no running task to interrupt.
#
# Making the tool an ``async def`` that awaits ``anyio.to_thread.run_sync``
# fixes the first half for free: the event loop is idle while the crawl runs,
# so ``sf_list_exports`` and friends stay responsive. The second half --
# actually stopping the child once the request is cancelled -- is the runner's
# to answer, because the runner is where the process is created. It publishes
# the crawlers it currently has running and stops them through the same
# ``_terminate_tree`` its own timeout uses, so there is one way to kill a crawl
# rather than two that must be kept in step.
#
# Replacing ``subprocess.Popen`` process-wide for the duration of a crawl would
# also have reached it, and would have reached far more: ``subprocess.run``
# resolves that module global at call time, so every unrelated child started
# anywhere in the process during the crawl would have been collected too, and
# cancelling the crawl would have sent SIGTERM to its process group.
#
# ``_RUN_LOCK`` serializes live crawls one at a time. Non-crawl sf_* tools
# (sf_list_exports, sf_audit_summary, ...) never touch it and stay answerable
# while a crawl is running.
