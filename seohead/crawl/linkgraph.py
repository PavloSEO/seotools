"""Site-wide inlink composition from a crawl's own link graph.

Link position (see ``tools/link_position.py``) only earns its keep once it is
aggregated across a crawl: one classified link says where that one anchor
sits, but "this page is linked only from the footer, never from body copy" is
a statement about every inlink a page has, and that is a template-level
finding, not a page-level one.

This module is pure and never imports ``seohead.sf``: it works only from
``SpiderResult.links``, the collector's own evidence.

    repeated twice on the same page in the same position is one inlink, not
    two — the same "how many pages link here" question ``sf.core.inlinks``
    answers for Screaming Frog exports.

    ``internal_host`` is the site being crawled. Destinations on any other host
    are counted in ``edges_external`` and take no further part: "this page is
    linked only from the footer, never from body copy" is advice to add a
    contextual link, and nobody can add one to somebody else's site (#208). The
    edges themselves stay in ``SpiderResult.links`` — this excludes them from a
    conclusion, it does not discard the evidence. ``sf.core.inlinks`` partitions
    the same way for Screaming Frog exports; this is that rule, not a second one.

    Without an ``internal_host`` nothing can be told apart, so every destination
    is reported as unpartitioned and ``boilerplate_only`` is withheld from all of
    them: an unknown population must read as "not measured", never as "all
    internal".

    Edges with no ``position`` (because the crawl did not pass
    ``classify_links=True``) are counted separately as ``edges_unclassified``
