"""Bounded fetching of an explicit URL list.

List mode is a strict subset of a crawler: no frontier, no scope model, no
traps, so its output is deterministic by construction. It is also the slice that
does real work on day one — verifying a redirect map after a migration,
re-checking the URLs a developer says are fixed, auditing a Search Console
export.

Rows are written as they are collected. Screaming Frog writes its exports only
at the end, which is why a measured 75-minute polite crawl of a struggling host
produced nothing at all; a collector that batches to the end inherits that
failure exactly where crawling is hardest.

    call with headers resolved for the new host, not these carried forward.

    ``retry_on_timeout`` retries only a timeout — a connect, TLS, or read
    timeout, per ``_classify_fetch_error`` — never a connection failure (refused,

    ``cache``, when given, is consulted before anything else touches the network — see

    revalidated — still correct, just less efficient. ``wait``, when given, is called once
    before every real network round trip this call makes, including a timeout retry — never
    called at all on a cache hit, which is what keeps a hit from consuming a throttle delay slot
    or a concurrent dispatch turn it never needed. A retried timeout also updates ``throttle``

    checked before a URL is fetched, not merely before it is parsed: a URL over
    the limit is skipped rather than requested.

    ``parse_options`` is forwarded to every ``parse_html`` call unchanged; see

    checking exactly the URLs you handed it, so silently applying the

    the configured ``robots.policy`` explicitly, which is what makes the
    policy "whatever the configuration says" rather than hard-coded either
    way — see #21. ``"respect"`` drops a disallowed URL from ``pages``
    entirely (into ``robots_blocked`` instead); ``"report_only"`` fetches it
