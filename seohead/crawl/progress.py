"""Live crawl progress: what the crawl knows right now, never a completion estimate.

A native crawl of a large site used to print one rate line and then nothing for
an hour (issue #619). Everything an operator needs was already in the spider --
the frontier, the fetched count, the URL budget -- and none of it reached them.

The one thing this module refuses to do is imply a total it does not have. A
crawler discovers its own workload: the frontier grows as links are found, so
"25%" is a percentage of what is known *now*, and the set it is a percentage of
will very likely be larger a minute from now. That is said in a header line
printed once, and the number itself is labelled "known", never "total".

The denominator is ``fetched + queued``, capped at the URL budget:

* excluded URLs (out of scope, robots-blocked, over a limit) are not remaining
  work, so counting them would leave the percentage permanently short of 100
  and make a finished crawl read as a stalled one;
* the budget is a real ceiling -- with ``max_urls=200`` a crawl that has found
  34 000 URLs will still fetch 200 -- so an uncapped denominator would report
  0% on a crawl that is one page from stopping.

Either can move the denominator down (an exclusion drops a queued URL), so
``known`` is not monotonic. That is the truth about the crawl rather than a
smoothed number, and every value printed describes the state that produced it.

Output goes to a caller-supplied stream (stderr for the CLI, so the JSON result
on stdout stays clean). On a TTY the line is redrawn in place with a carriage
return; on anything else -- a pipe, a log file, CI -- plain lines are printed on
a much longer interval instead, because a log full of carriage returns is worse
than no progress at all.
