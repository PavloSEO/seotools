"""One append-only journal of every command and MCP call this toolkit runs.

Two problems this solves, and the second is the reason it is worth building.

**Answering "what did the agent actually do".** A CLI and a stdio MCP server both
leave nothing behind once the process exits. When an audit produced a surprising
number, the question is which tools ran, against what, with which arguments and
how long they took — and today that is unanswerable after the fact.

**Making repeated work visible before it is repeated.** Every entry carries a
fingerprint of the call and where its output landed, so a later run can see that
the same tool ran against the same target minutes ago.

**Reusing that work, but only where staleness is nobody's problem.** Whether a stale answer is
acceptable is a property of the *question*, not of the tool: a parse of a page a client just
fixed must not come back from five minutes ago, but a domain registration lookup almost
certainly may. So reuse here is opt-in per tool (``reuse_policy`` / ``SEOHEAD_REUSE_POLICY``),
defaults to never, and is never silent — a reused answer is marked ``reused: true`` in both the
returned result and the journal entry that answered it. See ``journaled``.

Format is JSONL, one line per call, appended after the call completes so an
interrupted process cannot corrupt earlier entries. Default path is
``~/.config/seohead/runs.jsonl``; override with ``SEOHEAD_RUN_LOG``, or set
``log.path`` in the config file. Set ``SEOHEAD_RUN_LOG=off`` to disable.
