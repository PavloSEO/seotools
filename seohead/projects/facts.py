"""Record project stack facts, keeping operator decisions above detected evidence.

The priority policy already reads ``project.json`` facts, but nothing could write
one after ``project new``: a stack had to be typed in by hand. This closes that
link. An operator-entered fact is a decision and a detected fact is evidence, so a
detection never overwrites an operator's value, and both keep saying which they are
through the ``provenance`` and ``observed_at`` fields the fact schema already has.
