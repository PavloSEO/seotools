"""Multi-site fact export: one comparable table of facts across several domains
whose audits the operator already ran.

The scope this module refuses on purpose is as important as what it does. It
never decides who is "better": no score, no rank, no ratio, no winner. It has
no access to rankings, traffic or intent, and it never will -- a language
model reads the export and does that analysis, not this code. It reads
documents the operator already produced (a Screaming Frog crawl audit from
``sf run``, or a ``seohead.site-audit/1`` document from :mod:`seohead.audit.site`)
and makes zero network requests. It is not a crawl orchestrator: it never
fetches, crawls, or calls a paid provider on its own.

Every leaf value in the export is a *fact*, built by :func:`fact`. A fact is
one of five states, because two distinctions matter that three would
collapse into one:

``measured``
    The source answered with a real value.
``absent``
    The source answered and the thing does not exist -- a true ``0`` or ``[]``.
    This is not "we didn't look"; it is "we looked and there is none".
``partial``
    The source answered, but the value is a bound, not the true total (a
    crawl that stopped early, a sampled page set). ``bound`` says which way
    it is bounded and why.
``unavailable``
    The source did not answer -- the document was not supplied, the field is
    missing, or the check that would have produced it did not run.
``not_requested``
    This tool deliberately never asks -- see ``INDEX_COUNT_IS_NOT_REQUESTED``
    below for the one case this export ships that way.

Two failures a design review found in an earlier draft, and the reason this
module refuses instead of best-effort guessing:

1. **Site-identity binding.** A crawl audit's own domain (from
   ``run["start_url"]`` or, when that field is absent, the nearest thing this
   toolkit's audits actually record -- ``run["source"]`` or ``run["project"]``)
   or a site-audit's ``document["domain"]`` must match the label the caller
   filed it under. One mislabelled file otherwise mislabels an entire column
   of the export, silently, and nothing downstream would ever notice.
2. **No derived ratio.** This module exports operands, never quotients. A
   normalised number like "sitemap coverage 94% vs 41%" is a league table in
   everything but name -- exactly the ranking judgment this tool must not
   make on the operator's behalf.
