## Look at these before trusting the rest

Each check below describes more than half the crawled pages. That can be true -- a site really may have no meta description anywhere -- but it is also what a broken check looks like, and it is worth one minute of checking against the live site before the rest of this report is acted on.

| Issue | Pages | Share of crawl |
|---|---:|---:|
| H2 is duplicated across multiple URLs | 3 | 75% |

## 🔴 Critical (3)

### Internal link points to a 4xx URL (1)

| Destination | Status | Source page | Anchor | Position | XPath |
|---|---:|---|---|---|---|
| https://example.com/old-page | 404 | https://example.com/ | Legacy Page | Content | `/html/body/main/article/p[3]/a` |
| https://example.com/old-page | 404 | https://example.com/page-a | view pump specifications | Footer | `/html/body/footer/nav/a[2]` |

> _How to fix:_ Update the link to the current URL or add an appropriate 301 redirect; if it appears in the footer or navigation, fix the shared template.

### Page returns a 4xx response (broken page) (1)

| URL | Details |
|---|---|
| https://example.com/old-page | Status: Not Found, Inlinks: 4 |

> _How to fix:_ Restore the page or redirect it with a 301 to a relevant URL; remove or update links that point to it.

### Title element is missing (1)

- https://example.com/no-title

> _How to fix:_ Add a unique, descriptive title element.

## 🟡 Warning (10)

### Indexable page has no canonical URL (1)

- https://example.com/no-title

> _How to fix:_ Add a valid <link rel="canonical"> element.

### Duplicate meta description (2)

- **"A sample description over seventy characters that reliably meets the configured audit threshold."** — 2 URLs:
    - https://example.com/
    - https://example.com/page-b

> _How to fix:_ Write a unique meta description for each page.

### Meta description is missing (1)

- https://example.com/no-title

> _How to fix:_ Add a useful meta description, typically up to about 160 characters.

### Multiple H1 headings on the page (1)

| URL | H1 text |
|---|---|
| https://example.com/page-a | Pump Models ⏐ Second H1 Heading |

> _How to fix:_ Keep one primary H1 and demote the remaining headings to H2 or H3 as appropriate.

### HTML document is large in absolute terms or relative to the site (1)

| URL | Size | × median | Rank |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| https://example.com/no-title | 293 KB | ×3.87 | 1 |

> _How to fix:_ Reduce HTML size by removing unnecessary markup, extracting inline styles or scripts, and avoiding embedded base64 assets.

### Slow server response (1)

| URL | Details |
|---|---|
| https://example.com/no-title | Response time: 2.0, Max s: 1.5 |

> _How to fix:_ Improve TTFB by profiling the application and origin, then optimizing caching and infrastructure.

### Thin content (low word count) (1)

| URL | Details |
|---|---|
| https://example.com/page-b | Word count: 50, Threshold: 200 |

> _How to fix:_ Add substantial, useful content or exclude the page from indexing when it has no standalone search value.

### Duplicate title element (2)

- **"Industrial Pumps Product A"** — 2 URLs:
    - https://example.com/page-a
    - https://example.com/page-b

> _How to fix:_ Give each page a unique title element.

## ⚪ Notice (8)

### Meta description falls below the configured length threshold (1)

| URL | Details |
|---|---|
| https://example.com/page-a | Length: 7, Min chars: 70 |

> _How to fix:_ Expand the description with specific, useful page information.

### H2 is duplicated across multiple URLs (3)

| URL | Details |
|---|---|
| https://example.com/ | Value: Section, Duplicate count: 3 |
| https://example.com/no-title | Value: Section, Duplicate count: 3 |
| https://example.com/page-a | Value: Section, Duplicate count: 3 |

> _How to fix:_ Use a unique, page-specific H2 on each URL, or accept it for a shared boilerplate subheading that is genuinely meant to repeat.

### HTML bloat: high document size relative to text content (1)

| URL | Details |
|---|---|
| https://example.com/page-b | Bytes per word: 1600.0, Site median bpw: 375.0, Word count: 50, Size bytes: 80000 |

> _How to fix:_ Reduce bytes per word by extracting styles and scripts, removing embedded base64 assets, and simplifying markup.

### Low text-to-HTML ratio (1)

| URL | Details |
|---|---|
| https://example.com/page-b | Text ratio: 8.0, Threshold: 10 |

> _How to fix:_ Increase the proportion of meaningful visible content or reduce unnecessary markup.

### Title falls below the configured length threshold (2)

| URL | Details |
|---|---|
| https://example.com/page-a | Title: Industrial Pumps Product A, Length: 26, Min chars: 30 |
| https://example.com/page-b | Title: Industrial Pumps Product A, Length: 26, Min chars: 30 |

> _How to fix:_ Expand the title to an informative length without padding it with boilerplate.
