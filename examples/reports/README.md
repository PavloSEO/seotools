# Report templates: what to provide to generate each file

Every report is rendered from one document: the result of `site-audit`. Report
generators do not calculate metrics or make network requests: **if a value is not
in the JSON document, it will not appear in the report**. These two samples show
which values belong in each field.

| File | Purpose |
|---|---|
| [`minimal.json`](minimal.json) | The smallest document that can produce a report |
| [`full.json`](full.json) | A fully populated sample containing every report section |
| [`seo-audit-sample/seo-audit-sample-ru.pdf`](seo-audit-sample/seo-audit-sample-ru.pdf) | 23-page Russian visual example |
| [`seo-audit-sample/seo-audit-sample-en.pdf`](seo-audit-sample/seo-audit-sample-en.pdf) | 23-page English visual example |

The two PDF examples use an invented demo company, the reserved `example.invalid`
domain and entirely synthetic figures. They contain no client logo, client identity,
analytics exports or real measurements. They illustrate a client-style monthly SEO
report; they are static visual examples and are not outputs of the `site-audit` JSON
report contract described below.

Rebuild them with `python examples/reports/build_seo_sample.py`. The self-contained
builder uses the repository's Chromium PDF renderer and synthetic data only. Its visual
direction is a restrained presentation deck: blue chapter markers, readable metric
cards, consistent search-source colors, concise chart titles, clear tables and a
fictional geometric demo mark. If you adapt the design with an image-generation tool,
create a new abstract mark for a fictional brand; do not extract or reuse a customer's
logo, names, URL, analytics values, screenshots or report-specific facts.
The [visual brief](seo-audit-sample/visual-brief.md) provides prompts for future layout
and fictional-logo work.

The technical-audit PDF layout is a separate renderer in `seohead/reports/audit_pdf.py`.
`render_audit_pdf_html` accepts a `seohead.technical-audit-pdf/1` presentation model and
returns self-contained English or Russian 16:9 HTML with neutral brand tokens, inline
charts, and print pagination. It does not build the model or run checks. The PDF model builder
and `report-build` CLI/MCP integration are separate work items; the existing report
command does not yet emit technical-audit PDFs. Printing uses the existing local Chromium
helper and a system font stack; no external fonts or services are fetched.

## Try it now

```bash
seohead report-build --audit examples/reports/full.json --format xlsx --out audit.xlsx
seohead report-build --audit examples/reports/full.json --format docx --out audit.docx
seohead report-build --audit examples/reports/full.json --format csv  --out audit.csv
seohead report-build --audit examples/reports/full.json --format md   --out audit.md
```

In normal use, you do not fill in the document manually. Run the audit and build
the report in one command:

```bash
seohead site-audit --url https://example.org/ --limit 50 --report xlsx --out audit.xlsx
```

## Document contract (`seohead.site-audit/1`)

### Required minimum

| Field | Type | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `schema` | string | Always `seohead.site-audit/1`; it identifies the document structure |
| `domain` | string | Used in the report title and default output filename |
| `findings` | array | The report's primary content; see below |
| `pages` | array | Page table; may be empty |
| `summary` | object | Totals used in the summary and chart |

### `findings[]` — findings

```json
{"source": "render_check", "severity": "critical",
 "url": "https://example.org/catalog", "text": "A concise description of the problem"}
```

- `severity` — `critical`, `warning`, or `notice`. It is **assigned by the
  aggregator rules** (`SEVERITY_RULES` in `seohead/audit/site.py`), not measured
  by an individual tool. The document states this explicitly in
  `summary.severity_note`.
- `url` — optional; site-wide findings do not have one.
- `text` — a human-readable description. It is copied into the report verbatim,
  so write it exactly as it should appear in the client-facing document.

Findings are ordered from critical problems to informational notices. Word groups
them by severity; Excel provides a filter on the `Severity` column.

### `pages[]` — page table

Excel and Word columns are populated from `url`, `status`, `title`,
`title_length`, `description_length`, `h1`, `canonical`, `words`,
`schema_types`, `schema_errors`, and `social_missing`. Missing values remain
blank and do not cause an error.

### `summary` — summary

```json
{"pages_checked": 2, "findings_total": 4,
 "findings_by_severity": {"critical": 1, "warning": 1, "notice": 2},
 "tools_run": ["domain_profile", "tech_detect"],
 "tools_failed": [{"tool": "log_analyze", "error": "Log file was not provided"}],
 "severity_note": "Severity is assigned by the aggregator rules"}
```

**`tools_failed` is the most important field in the document.** A check that
could not run belongs here, and all report formats render it in a separate
`Not covered by this report` section. A silent check must not be interpreted as
`no problems found`; the report must distinguish those outcomes.

### `site` — raw tool responses

Responses are stored unchanged under their handler names, such as
`domain_profile`, `tech_detect`, `security_check`, and `regions_check`. Excel
uses them to build the `Technologies` sheet; the remaining data stays available
for readers who need implementation details.

## Technical audit PDF semantic model

`seohead.reports.pdf_model.build_pdf_model(audit, project=None)` projects either
recognized audit contract into a model whose `schema` is
`seohead.technical-audit-pdf/1`. It is an offline
semantic document for a later PDF layout/renderer; it adds no checks, network
calls, CLI command or MCP tool.

The model keeps source kind/schema, identity and run scope; the exact source
summary beside source-array and projected-row counts; coverage groups and their
original reasons; every finding and page in source order with a source pointer
and full original record; and display fields for layout. A bounded display
summary does not discard the full finding record. Missing declared totals stay
`not_reported`, while an empty source array is a measured zero-row collection.
Run state is `failed`, `partial`, `complete` or `unknown` only when supported by
the source. For `site-audit`, `run.scope.operation` identifies the bounded pass;
`complete` means the supplied operation returned, not that the whole site was
exhaustively crawled. `coverage.state` means coverage metadata was reported, not
that every check completed. Layouts must show individual failed, skipped,
disabled, unavailable and unmeasured evidence rather than infer a clean result.

The optional `project` argument reads the current local checklist snapshot and
places its complete item rows, verification state and counts under `backlog`.
Without an embedded or requested checklist, `backlog.state` is
`not_requested` and its source count stays unavailable. `omissions` records
intentional exclusions; the model does not silently cap findings, pages,
coverage or backlog rows.

This model defines content fields only. Localized labels, brand tokens, charts,
page flow and HTML belong to the separate PDF layout/rendering work.

The shared `report-build` command and MCP tool can render this model to PDF in
English or Russian with `--format pdf --lang en|ru`. The report is built from
saved evidence and local checklist state only; rendering performs no network
requests. It requires the `seohead-seotools[pdf]` extra and a local
Chrome/Edge/Chromium installation. Output is validated before it replaces the
requested destination.

## What each format provides

| Format | Intended use | Contents |
|---|---|---|
| `xlsx` | Working file | Four sheets, auto-filters, and a live Excel severity chart |
| `docx` | Client deliverable | Headings, findings grouped by severity, and the first 60 pages |
| `csv` | Import | Two files: findings and `*.pages.csv`; semicolon delimiter and Excel-compatible BOM |
| `md` | Git and reading | The complete report in one file |
| `json` | Data exchange | The same document, formatted as JSON |

## Optional dependencies

```bash
pip install -e ".[reports]"     # openpyxl + python-docx
```

Without these dependencies, `csv`, `md`, and `json` still work. The `xlsx` and
`docx` renderers return `ok: false` with the installation command; that failure
is represented as result data rather than a process crash.
