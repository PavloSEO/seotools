"""Evidence that never arrived must be reported as skipped, never as clean.

Before this, a check whose export was absent simply did not fire, and a report
renders "did not fire" as "found nothing". The arithmetic made it worse: the
health score is 100 - penalty/pages, so fewer checks running produced a *higher*
score and a partial evidence source flattered the site it measured least.

The score is deliberately not rescaled by coverage — estimating what the checks
that never ran would have found is invention. Comparability is refused instead:
coverage is machine-readable, and below a floor no score is emitted at all.
