"""Live crawl progress (#619): the numbers on screen must be the crawl's real ones.

A progress line is only worth printing if it can be believed. The load-bearing
test here crawls the offline fixture site into a SQLite scan and, at every point
the crawler reports progress, opens a *separate* read-only connection to the
artifact and counts the rows it actually holds. A reported count that came from
a parallel in-memory tally rather than the artifact would drift from that and
fail here.

The rest guards the other half of believing it: a percentage of a frontier that
is still growing must not read as a completion estimate, an unmeasured rate must
not read as a stalled crawl, ``-q`` must be silent, and a non-TTY must get whole
lines rather than carriage returns.
