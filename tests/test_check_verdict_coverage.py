"""Issue #98: the traversal is tested, the verdicts are not.

``test_check_producer_gate.py`` proves every check ID is registered and every
``check_*`` function is dispatched -- the traversal runs. It says nothing about
whether a check's *conclusion* is ever proven true: that it fires on markup
that genuinely carries its defect, and stays silent on markup that does not.
#94, #95 and #96 each passed every existing gate and were still wrong on real
sites -- one fired on legitimate outbound links, one fired on a slash-form
pair no fixture had ever paired, one miscounted boilerplate as content. None
of that shows up as a registration gap or a dispatch gap.

This gate closes that: for every check in ``seohead.sf.core.registry.CHECKS``
it looks for a test, anywhere under ``tests/``, that asserts BOTH halves --
some assertion showing the check fires on a URL with the defect, and some
assertion (in the same or a different test) showing it stays silent on a
clean URL. Evidence is detected structurally (AST), not by a fixed list of
call sites, so it doesn't go stale as tests are rewritten -- the same
principle ``test_check_producer_gate.py`` already uses for producer/dispatch
completeness.

A check that cannot be exercised offline at all belongs in
``LIVE_ONLY_EXEMPT`` with a reason -- not silently skipped. As of this gate's
introduction that list is empty: every check in this registry reads columns a
synthetic Screaming Frog export or synthetic HTML can carry (see
``AGENTS.md`` -- "SF-derived", "SF:<tab>", "inlinks", "sitemap", "crawl" and
"heuristic" sources are all reproducible without a network, a licensed SF
CLI run, or a browser). If a future check genuinely needs one of those, name
it here with why, rather than adding it to the uncovered baseline.

Checks proven both ways are exempt from ``KNOWN_UNCOVERED``. Everything else
must be named in ``KNOWN_UNCOVERED`` -- a ratchet, not a permanent pass: a
check already in it may stay there while nobody has closed it, but the moment
a test proves it (a merge that closes this list a little further, the way
#help-wanted "close a few" pull requests do), the entry becomes a stale
extra-credit and ``test_known_uncovered_entries_stay_actually_uncovered``
below starts failing to force its removal. A *new* check_id -- one added to
CHECKS tomorrow -- has no seat in that baseline: it must ship with both
halves proven, or with a named, reasoned exemption, or the build fails. That
is the enforcement issue #98 asked for.
