# Scenario 35 — Rendering: does a crawler see what a visitor sees

## The question

> The page looks fine in my browser. Why does the audit say it has no content?

## Covers

- **JavaScript** — Contains JavaScript Content · Contains JavaScript Links · Pages with Blocked Resources

## The chain

**1. Compare raw HTML against the rendered DOM for one page.**

```bash
seohead render-check --url https://example.com/page --viewport desktop --wait load
```

This is the diagnosis, and it is one request plus one browser render. It reports what exists
only after JavaScript: text, internal links, title, canonical, `h1`, and Schema.org — plus lab
timings (TTFB, FCP, LCP, CLS).

**2. If the crawl itself needs rendering, it says so before scoring anything.** A crawl whose
start page has zero internal links, or an empty SPA shell, sets `requires_rendering` and
withholds the health score. A green audit of a page a static crawler could not read is worse
than no audit.

**3. Turn rendering on selectively, not everywhere.** In the crawler config:

```json
{"rendering": {"mode": "js", "escalation": {"sample_per_pattern": 2, "max_render_urls": 30}}}
```

Two URLs per detected template pattern are probed raw-versus-rendered; only patterns that
actually differ are escalated. Rendering every page of a 3000-URL site to find the one template
that hydrates its links costs an order of magnitude more for the same answer.

```bash
seohead crawl-site --url https://example.com --config ./crawl.json --out-dir ./run
```

**4. Every page records how it was measured.** `representation` is `static`, `rendered` or
`legacy_fragment` per page, so a report never silently mixes two populations of numbers.

## What comes out

```json
{
  "js_dependent": true,
  "raw": {"links": 0, "words": 12},
  "rendered": {"links": 34, "words": 812},
  "empty_shell": true
}
```

`dual_crawl` (schema `dualcrawl.v1`) rides alongside this in the same response: it diffs the raw
and rendered evidence per URL (images, links) instead of one page's before/after, so a report can
tell "this page changed" (the block above) apart from "these two collection methods disagree
about what this page contains" (`dual_crawl`) — see `js-render-check`.

Zero links raw and 34 rendered is the whole finding: every crawler that does not execute
JavaScript sees a dead end.

## When the render itself did not finish

A browser that fails mid-navigation still returns a document, and that document is nearly
empty. Compared naively against a full raw response it reads as the site deleting its own
metadata — "the title changes after JavaScript" from a title the render never read (#623).
So the pair is judged before it is compared: a rendered document with no title, no `h1`, no
canonical and no internal links, at a fraction of the raw response's byte size, did not
capture the page.

```json
{
  "ok": false,
  "reason": "incomplete_render",
  "error": "The rendered DOM was not captured, so the raw-versus-rendered comparison is unavailable: ...",
  "js_dependent": null
}
```

No `findings` are emitted from that state, and `js_dependent` is `null` rather than `false`:
the run does not know. Both snapshots are returned so the reason can be checked. In
`site-audit` this lands in `summary.tools_failed`, where an unmeasured check belongs, not in
the findings list.

A wait milestone that never arrives is the ordinary cause. A site with long-polling
analytics, chat or ad scripts never goes network-idle, so `--wait networkidle` times out
where the page is in fact complete; when that happens the DOM is read at `domcontentloaded`
instead of the check being lost, and `wait_reached` records which milestone the snapshot
actually came from. A short settle after the milestone gives deferred scripts time to write
the DOM.

## What it costs

A headless browser per rendered URL — seconds each, not milliseconds, and real memory. That is
why escalation samples patterns instead of rendering everything. The static crawl costs one
request per page as usual.

## What it cannot answer

- **What Google actually rendered.** This is a headless Chromium, not Googlebot's renderer, on
  a different schedule with different budgets. It answers "is this content JS-dependent",
  which is the actionable half.
- **Whether rendering delay costs rankings.** Nobody outside Google can measure that.
- **Field performance.** LCP and CLS here are lab numbers from one machine on one connection.
- **Anything behind a login.** Attaching a real browser profile crawls as whoever's cookies it
  carries, which is off by default and refused without an explicit directory.
