# Scenario 3 — Content extraction: how much of this page is actually the page

## The question

> The audit says these pages are fine. Read one and tell me what it really says.

## Covers

- **Content** — Low Content Pages · Near Duplicates

## The chain

**1. Extract the content region as Markdown.**

```bash
seohead markdown-extract --url https://example.com/page
```

Two renderings come back: `content_markdown` (the content region only) and `full_markdown`
(everything, header and footer included). The difference between them *is* the boilerplate.

The region is detected from the document's own semantics — `<main>`, then `[role="main"]`,
then `<article>` — and the strategy used is reported per page as `auto_main`, `auto_role_main`,
`auto_article` or `default_body`. On a live WordPress post, the whole-body default counted 433
words where `<main>` holds 429: 126 of them template, including a skip-to-content link and the
literal word "header".

**2. Override it when a site's markup is not semantic.**

```bash
seohead markdown-extract --input '{"url": "https://example.com/page", "content_area": {"include_selector": "#content"}}'
```

Configuration wins over detection. A selector that matches nothing reports
`fallback_default_body` rather than quietly detecting something else — a wrong selector should
be visible, not smoothed over.

**3. Find where the template drifts across pages.** `boilerplate-report` hashes header/nav/footer
*markup* — it needs the original HTML, or a hash already computed from that HTML. `full_markdown`
from step 1 has already stripped the tag structure the hash depends on, so it is not a valid
input here; two differently-templated pages fed as Markdown collapse into the hash of an empty
string and look identical.

```bash
seohead boilerplate-report --input '{"pages": [{"url": "https://example.com/a", "html": "<html>...</html>"}, {"url": "https://example.com/b", "html": "<html>...</html>"}]}'
```

Pass a precomputed digest instead with the `hash` key (not `boilerplate_hash`, which the handler
does not recognize) when the HTML itself should not be sent again:

```bash
seohead boilerplate-report --input '{"pages": [{"url": "https://example.com/a", "hash": "aaa..."}, {"url": "https://example.com/b", "hash": "bbb..."}]}'
```

Hashing header and footer per page finds the pages whose template differs from every other —
usually a legacy section nobody remembers, sometimes a broken include.

## What comes out

```
strategy: auto_main
content:  429 words
full:     1104 words
```

Two-thirds of that page is navigation and footer. Any threshold applied to the larger number
is measuring the template.

## What it costs

One request per page. Local parsing. Nothing paid.

## What it cannot answer

- **Whether the content is good.** Extraction is not judgement.
- **What a *reader* considers the content.** A page whose sidebar carries the real answer will
  be extracted as if the sidebar were furniture. Override the selector when that is the case.
- **Content assembled by JavaScript.** See the [rendering scenario](rendering.md).
