# Provider capability and workflow matrix

Generated from `seohead/data_sources/providers.py` and the workflow catalogue in `seohead/provider_matrix.py` — do not edit by hand. Regenerate with:

Issue #779 (epic #753). Related implementation issues: #716, #718, #719, #724, #730 — this matrix links them instead of duplicating their scopes.

## How to read the statuses

- **supported** — a shipped command or collection dispatch reaches the operation, with offline tests behind it.
- **partial** — the workflow works but the shipped surface is narrower than the declared registry entry; the gap is named in the limitations column.
- **unsupported** — declared or plausible work the code deliberately does not do; see *Unsupported work* below.
- **unverified** — no code path exists to confirm or deny; nothing in this matrix is labelled live-verified: a registry entry is a declared contract, a present credential is configuration state, and only an explicit `provider-verify` read returning `target_access=verified` proves live target access.

Provider names in the workflow matrix are typed routes: a bare ``name`` is a registry id reached through `provider-verify`/`provider-collect`; ``name`` *(dedicated integration)* is a module the handlers call directly outside the registry dispatch; ``name`` *(in-process)* is a local computation with no provider transport; ``name`` *(declared registry operation — no shipped route)* is a contract the registry declares but no shipped surface reaches.

## Specialist workflow matrix

| Workflow | Use case | Providers | Shipped surface | Status | Auth | Cost / quota | Privacy | Limitations | CSV fallback |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `yandex-demand` | Expand a seed phrase and read demand seasonality for Yandex | `yandex_cloud` (dedicated integration) | `keywords-expand`, `keywords-seasonality`, `regions-tree` | supported | API key + folder ID | Paid; Wordstat hourly quota; charges journaled in spend-report | aggregate | Base frequency only — the API has no ! / + / [] operators and base counts run roughly 9x exact; use Arsenkin for exact values. The commands call the dedicated yandex_cloud module (Wordstat) directly; provider-collect deliberately refuses this paid contract | not applicable — demand data is not URL-keyed |
| `yandex-exact-frequency` | Exact !W frequency the Wordstat API does not expose | `arsenkin` (dedicated integration) | `keywords-exact` | supported | API token | Paid; consumes Arsenkin account limits; task_id journaled at billing time | aggregate | Billed at task creation; a timed-out poll is retrievable by task_id. The command calls ArsenkinClient.set_task directly; provider-collect deliberately refuses this paid contract | not applicable |
| `google-demand` | Search volume, seed expansion, and keyword difficulty for Google | `dataforseo` (dedicated integration) | `google-keywords` | supported | Login + password | Paid per response; sandbox is the default and is free | restricted | The handler calls seohead.data_sources.dataforseo (source `dataforseo`) directly — a dedicated integration, not the `dataforseo_backlinks` registry entry, which declares only backlinks_summary; Russia and Belarus locations are refused by the coverage guard before any paid call | not applicable |
| `serp-collection` | Fetch ranked results for queries on Yandex or Google | `yandex_cloud` (dedicated integration), `dataforseo` (dedicated integration) | `serp-fetch`, `google-serp` | supported | Yandex: API key + folder ID; DataForSEO: login + password | Metered; Yandex async endpoint only — the ~16x-costlier sync endpoint is excluded | aggregate | Both routes are dedicated modules the handlers call directly — serp-fetch uses yandex_cloud.WebSearch, google-serp uses the dataforseo integration, not the registry; queries billed but not returned before timeout stay visible in the spend journal as named operations | not applicable |
| `keyword-text-clustering` | Draft-group a caller-supplied keyword list by text similarity | `seohead.tools.clusterer` (in-process) | `keywords-cluster` | supported | None — in-process computation | Free; requires the optional 'cluster' dependency extra (scikit-learn) | caller-supplied keyword list stays in-process; no provider transport exists | TF-IDF similarity over keyword text only — it never fetches or compares search results and has no provider route; SERP-based clustering is the separate serp-clustering workflow below | a user-supplied keyword list is the input itself |
| `serp-clustering` | Cluster a keyword set by overlapping search results | `arsenkin` (declared registry operation — no shipped route) | — | unsupported | Arsenkin API token would be required for the declared provider operation | Declared paid operation; consumes Arsenkin account limits | aggregate | The registry declares arsenkin serp_clustering, but provider-collect deliberately refuses the paid Arsenkin contract and no dedicated handler ships it — keywords-cluster is text-similarity clustering, not this workflow | none |
| `search-console-evidence` | Clicks, impressions, position, indexing verdicts, and sitemap status for a property you own | `gsc` | `gsc-query`, `provider-auth`, `provider-verify`, `provider-collect` | supported | OAuth bearer or service account; durable grant via provider-auth | Free within Search Console row and request limits | restricted | Verification distinguishes an authenticated account from verified access to the requested property | yes — an exported Search Console CSV joins the crawl via provider-join |
| `webmaster-evidence` | Yandex and Bing webmaster data: hosts, indexing, diagnostics, search performance, history | `yandex_webmaster`, `bing_webmaster` | `provider-verify`, `provider-collect` | supported | Yandex: OAuth bearer; Bing: API key | Free within each webmaster API quota | restricted | Reachable only through the generic provider-verify/provider-collect commands — no dedicated CLI command ships for either provider | yes — URL-keyed exports join via provider-join |
| `traffic-analytics` | Counter configuration, aggregate reports, and landing-page evidence | `metrika`, `ga4` | `metrika-counters`, `metrika-setup`, `metrika-report`, `metrika-traffic-pdf`, `provider-collect` | partial | OAuth bearer for both providers | Free within Metrika and GA4 Data API quotas | restricted — may contain personal identifiers; kept out of reports and commits | Metrika raw Logs API is intentionally unreachable; GA4 ships only the landing_pages operation and only via provider-collect | yes — URL-keyed analytics exports join via provider-join |
| `field-vitals` | Core Web Vitals as real users measured them — CrUX field data at origin or URL level | `crux` | `crux-report`, `provider-collect`, `site-audit` | supported | Google Cloud API key | Free within Google API quotas | aggregate | Field p75 verdicts require an eligible CrUX current record and valid collection period; no data or missing metrics are unavailable, not passing. Site-audit consumes explicitly supplied evidence and never calls CrUX automatically | no provider CSV join; CrUX has no user-export path here |
| `lab-vitals` | Lighthouse lab samples via PageSpeed Insights — categories and audits | `pagespeed` | `provider-collect` | supported | Google API key | Free within Google API quotas | aggregate | The PSI parser deliberately returns Lighthouse lab data marked lab_only: true — a synthetic measurement, not real-user field data; mobile_samples/desktop_samples run only via provider-collect, no dedicated command ships | no provider CSV join; PSI has no user-export path here |
| `link-evidence` | Backlink summary for a target from a paid index | `dataforseo_backlinks` | `provider-collect` | partial | Login + password | Paid per provider response; provider is off by default | restricted | Only backlinks_summary is declared; discovering a competitor's full profile is out of scope — backlinks-check audits a caller-supplied donor list instead and is not a provider | a supplied donor-page list is the input to backlinks-check; no provider CSV join |
| `rank-tracking` | Read existing Topvisor projects, keywords, competitors, recorded position history and summaries | `topvisor` (dedicated integration) | `topvisor-read` | supported | API token + user ID from the central credential files | Reads within the existing Topvisor account; paid position-check launches are structurally unreachable | restricted | One bounded page per call — the continuation signal is the provider's nextOffset, not len(result) == limit; a "--" position is unavailable, not rank 0; only fixed get endpoints are wired, so add/edit/del and paid checker launches cannot be reached | not applicable — Topvisor rows have no provider-join route |
| `url-submission` | Notify Bing, Yandex, Naver, and Seznam that URLs changed | `indexnow` (dedicated integration) | `indexnow-submit` | supported | Self-generated key hosted on the target site | Free; provider submission quota; off by default | caller-supplied URL list sent to a public endpoint | Confirmed write, not a collection — the command calls the dedicated indexnow.submit directly and provider-collect refuses it by contract; Google has not joined IndexNow | not applicable — write operation |
| `public-recon` | Snapshot history of a URL and subdomains named in public certificate logs | `wayback`, `crtsh` | `wayback-history`, `crtsh-subdomains` | supported | None — public services | Free; public service pacing and availability | public | provider-verify reports not_required — there is no access contract to verify | not applicable |
| `evidence-join` | Attach external URL-keyed rows to a crawl and surface orphan candidates for explicit review | `gsc`, `ga4`, `metrika`, `yandex_webmaster`, `bing_webmaster` | `provider-join`, `provider-replay` | supported | None — operates on already-collected or user-supplied rows | Free; local operation | restricted inputs stay local; artifact directory is created mode 0700 | Never changes the crawl frontier; unkeyable, crawl-only, and external-only populations stay named and separate | yes — this is the CSV fallback path itself |

## Unsupported work, stated explicitly

- **arsenkin serp_clustering via provider-collect** — declared in the registry but deliberately refused by the collection dispatch; tracked by the dedicated-operation contract rather than duplicated here
- **metrika raw_logs (Yandex Logs API)** — excluded by design — raw logs may contain personal identifiers and must not reach reports or commits
- **dedicated CLI commands for ga4, pagespeed, yandex_webmaster, and bing_webmaster** — these providers are reachable only through provider-verify/provider-collect
- **Google IndexNow submission** — Google has not joined IndexNow; no operation can claim it
- **competitor backlink discovery beyond backlinks_summary** — out of declared scope; backlinks-check covers a caller-supplied donor list only
- **Topvisor mutations and paid position-check launches** — topvisor-read wires only fixed read-only get endpoints; add/edit/del and the paid checker stay unreachable by design

## Phased first release

The first release phase covers the workflows whose evidence is free or already bounded by first-party quotas: `public-recon`, `evidence-join`, `keyword-text-clustering`, `search-console-evidence`, `webmaster-evidence`, `field-vitals`, `lab-vitals`, `traffic-analytics`, and `url-submission` behind its existing confirmed-write gate. Phase two adds the metered demand and SERP workflows (`yandex-demand`, `yandex-exact-frequency`, `google-demand`, `serp-collection`) once the caller deliberately configures the paid credentials they require — sandbox remains the DataForSEO default. Deferred by design, not by omission: `serp-clustering` via the paid Arsenkin contract (declared but unsupported), Metrika raw logs, dedicated CLI commands for the collect-only providers, and any backlink discovery beyond `backlinks_summary`. This is a selected subset of the provider landscape, not a claim that every SEO data service is covered.

Every row above reflects code and test evidence in this repository; no provider is described as live-verified by this document.
