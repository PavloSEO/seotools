# Check catalogue

Generated from `seohead/sf/core/registry.py` — do not edit by hand. Regenerate with:

```

**152 checks.** Severity, evidence and fix all come from the same `CHECKS` dict the rule engine reads, so this table cannot say something the engine disagrees with.

- **Fires on** — what the check id means, in the registry's own words.
- **Evidence** — the `source` tag: which export or module has to be present for the check to run at all; its absence is why a check comes back `skipped` instead of a silent pass.
- **Fix** — the remedy the audit ships next to the finding.

## 7.A — indexing & response codes

| Check id | Severity | Evidence | Fires on | Fix |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `BROKEN_PAGE_4XX` | critical | SF:Response Codes:4xx | Page returns a 4xx response (broken page) | Restore the page or redirect it with a 301 to a relevant URL; remove or update links that point to it. |
| `SERVER_ERROR_5XX` | critical | SF:Response Codes:5xx | Page returns a 5xx response (server error) | Investigate the server or application; this error makes the page unavailable to users and crawlers. |
| `NO_RESPONSE` | critical | SF:Response Codes:No Response | No response (timeout, DNS, or connection failure) | Check host availability, DNS resolution, connectivity, and timeout settings. |
| `BLOCKED_BY_ROBOTS` | warning | SF:Response Codes:Blocked by Robots.txt | URL is blocked by robots.txt | Confirm that the block is intentional; pages intended for indexing should remain crawlable. |
| `NON_INDEXABLE_LINKED` | notice | SF-derived | Internally linked page is non-indexable | Decide whether the page should be indexable; otherwise remove unnecessary internal links and account for crawl-budget impact. |
| `IMPORTANT_URL_BLOCKED_BY_ROBOTS` | warning | SF-derived | Live page is blocked by robots.txt despite receiving internal links | robots.txt blocks crawling, not indexing, so link discovery is lost. Make the URL crawlable with a more specific Allow rule than the matching Disallow, and control indexing with canonical or noindex. A common case is pagination such as /blog?page=N blocked by Disallow: /*?. |
| `ROBOTS_BLOCKS_RESOURCES` | notice | sitemap | robots.txt blocks JavaScript or CSS resources required for rendering | Do not block .js, .css, or _next/static resources in robots.txt; otherwise Google may render the page incompletely. |

## 7.B — links & DOM localization

| Check id | Severity | Evidence | Fires on | Fix |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `BROKEN_INTERNAL_LINK` | critical | inlinks:Client Error (4xx) Inlinks | Internal link points to a 4xx URL | Update the link to the current URL or add an appropriate 301 redirect; if it appears in the footer or navigation, fix the shared template. |
| `LINK_TO_5XX` | critical | inlinks:Server Error (5xx) Inlinks | Internal link points to a 5xx URL | Repair the destination page or remove the link. |
| `INTERNAL_LINK_TO_REDIRECT` | warning | inlinks:Redirection (3xx) Inlinks | Internal link points to a redirect (3xx) | Point the link directly to the final URL to eliminate the unnecessary redirect hop. |
| `BROKEN_EXTERNAL_LINK` | warning | inlinks:Client Error (4xx) Inlinks | External link points to a 4xx or 5xx URL | Update or remove the broken external link, while accounting for sites that intentionally return 403 responses to crawlers. |
| `EXTERNAL_LINK_TO_REDIRECT` | notice | inlinks:Redirection (3xx) Inlinks | External link points to a redirect (3xx) | This is often acceptable for external sites; optionally update the link to point directly to the final URL. |
| `REDIRECT_CHAIN` | warning | SF:report Redirect Chains | Redirect chain contains two or more hops | Replace the chain with a single 301 redirect to the final URL. |
| `REDIRECT_LOOP` | critical | SF:report Redirect Chains | Redirect loop detected | Break the redirect cycle so every redirect path terminates at a valid destination. |
| `BAD_REDIRECT_TYPE` | notice | SF-derived | Temporary redirect (302, 303 or 307) used where a permanent redirect is expected | Use a 301 redirect when the move is permanent. |

## 7.C — title & meta description

| Check id | Severity | Evidence | Fires on | Fix |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `TITLE_MISSING` | critical | SF-derived | Title element is missing | Add a unique, descriptive title element. |
| `TITLE_DUPLICATE` | warning | SF-derived | Duplicate title element | Give each page a unique title element. |
| `TITLE_MULTIPLE` | warning | SF:Page Titles:Multiple | Multiple <title> elements | Keep exactly one <title> element in the document head. |
| `TITLE_TOO_LONG` | notice | SF-derived | Title exceeds the configured length threshold | Shorten the title to fit the configured character or pixel-width limit. |
| `TITLE_TOO_SHORT` | notice | SF-derived | Title falls below the configured length threshold | Expand the title to an informative length without padding it with boilerplate. |
| `TITLE_EQUALS_H1` | notice | SF-derived | Title is identical to the H1 | Differentiate the title and H1 by purpose, wording, or keyword emphasis. |
| `DESC_MISSING` | warning | SF-derived | Meta description is missing | Add a useful meta description, typically up to about 160 characters. |
| `DESC_MULTIPLE` | warning | crawl:meta_description_count | More than one <meta name="description"> element is present | Keep exactly one meta description element; a search engine reads only the first, so the rest are dead weight that hides which value is actually live. |
| `DESC_DUPLICATE` | warning | SF-derived | Duplicate meta description | Write a unique meta description for each page. |
| `DESC_TOO_LONG` | notice | SF-derived | Meta description exceeds the configured length threshold | Shorten the description while preserving its primary value proposition. |
| `DESC_TOO_SHORT` | notice | SF-derived | Meta description falls below the configured length threshold | Expand the description with specific, useful page information. |

## 7.D — headings (incl. multiple H1)

| Check id | Severity | Evidence | Fires on | Fix |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `H1_MISSING` | warning | SF-derived | H1 heading is missing | Add one H1 that clearly states the page topic. |
| `H1_MULTIPLE` | warning | SF:H1:Multiple | Multiple H1 headings on the page | Keep one primary H1 and demote the remaining headings to H2 or H3 as appropriate. |
| `H1_DUPLICATE` | notice | SF-derived | H1 is duplicated across multiple URLs | Use a unique, page-specific H1 on each URL. |
| `H1_TOO_LONG` | notice | SF-derived | H1 exceeds the configured length threshold | Shorten the H1 while retaining the page's main topic. |
| `H1_ALT_TEXT_ONLY` | notice | crawl:h1_alt_text | The H1 has no text of its own; its only content is an image's alt attribute | Add real, visible text to the H1 -- alt text describes an image to assistive technology, it is not a substitute for a heading a search engine reads as text. |
| `H2_MISSING` | notice | SF-derived | Page has an H1 but no H2 headings | Add meaningful H2 subheadings where needed to structure the content. |
| `H2_DUPLICATE` | notice | SF-derived | H2 is duplicated across multiple URLs | Use a unique, page-specific H2 on each URL, or accept it for a shared boilerplate subheading that is genuinely meant to repeat. |
| `H2_TOO_LONG` | notice | SF-derived | H2 exceeds the configured length threshold | Shorten the H2 while retaining what it introduces. |

## 7.E — canonical & directives

| Check id | Severity | Evidence | Fires on | Fix |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `CANONICAL_MISSING` | warning | SF-derived | Indexable page has no canonical URL | Add a valid <link rel="canonical"> element. |
| `CANONICALISED` | notice | SF-derived | Canonical points to a different URL | Confirm that cross-canonicalization is intentional and that the target is the preferred version. |
| `CANONICAL_NON_INDEXABLE` | warning | SF-derived | Canonical points to a non-indexable URL | Point the canonical to an indexable preferred version. |
| `NOINDEX` | notice | SF:Directives:Noindex | Page contains a noindex directive | Confirm that exclusion from indexing is intentional. |
| `NOFOLLOW_PAGE` | notice | SF:Directives:Nofollow | Page-level nofollow directive is present | Confirm the directive is intentional and review its effect on crawling and internal link equity. |
| `META_KEYWORDS_PRESENT` | notice | SF-derived | Obsolete meta keywords element is present | Remove it if desired; modern search engines ignore meta keywords. |

## 7.F — content: thin & duplicates

| Check id | Severity | Evidence | Fires on | Fix |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `THIN_CONTENT` | warning | SF-derived | Thin content (low word count) | Add substantial, useful content or exclude the page from indexing when it has no standalone search value. |
| `CONTENT_IN_IFRAME` | warning | crawl:content_frames | The page's content sits inside an iframe and is not attributed to this URL | Serve the framed copy in the page's own HTML. A search engine attributes an iframe's text to the framed document, not to the page that frames it, so the copy exists and earns this URL nothing. |
| `LOW_TEXT_RATIO` | notice | SF-derived | Low text-to-HTML ratio | Increase the proportion of meaningful visible content or reduce unnecessary markup. |
| `DUPLICATE_BY_HASH` | warning | SF-derived | Exact duplicate content (identical hash) | Consolidate duplicates with canonicalization or rewrite them to serve distinct search intent. |
| `NEAR_DUPLICATE` | warning | SF-derived | Near-duplicate content | Differentiate the pages with substantive content or consolidate them into one canonical page. |
| `LOREM_IPSUM_PLACEHOLDER` | warning | crawl:lorem_ipsum_count | The Lorem Ipsum placeholder passage appears in the page's own content area | Replace the placeholder passage with real, reviewed copy before the page goes live or stays indexed. |

## 7.G — images

| Check id | Severity | Evidence | Fires on | Fix |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `IMG_MISSING_ALT` | warning | SF:Images:Missing Alt Text | Image is missing alt text | Add concise, descriptive alt text when the image conveys content; use an empty alt attribute for decorative images. |
| `IMG_MISSING_ALT_ATTRIBUTE` | warning | crawl:images | An <img> has no alt attribute at all (not even alt="") | Add an alt attribute: descriptive text when the image conveys content, or alt="" when it is purely decorative -- an image with no alt attribute at all is read out as its filename by assistive technology, which alt="" correctly avoids. |
| `IMG_ALT_TOO_LONG` | notice | crawl:images | An image's alt text exceeds the configured length threshold | Shorten the alt text to a concise description; screen readers read the whole string aloud, and a search engine treats an overlong alt as a weaker signal. |

## 7.H — schema, hreflang, viewport

| Check id | Severity | Evidence | Fires on | Fix |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `SCHEMA_VALIDATION_ERROR` | warning | SF:Structured Data:Validation Errors | Structured data validation errors | Correct invalid JSON-LD or Microdata markup and retest it against the applicable vocabulary and rich-result requirements. |
| `STRUCTURED_DATA_PARSE_ERROR` | warning | crawl:jsonld_blocks | A JSON-LD block is present but did not parse as valid JSON | Fix the malformed JSON-LD block (a stray comma, an unescaped quote, or an unclosed brace commonly voids the whole block); a search engine ignores structured data it cannot parse the same as if none were present. |
| `HREFLANG_ERROR` | warning | SF:Hreflang | Hreflang implementation error | Ensure hreflang annotations are reciprocal and reference canonical URLs. |

## 7.I — URL hygiene & performance

| Check id | Severity | Evidence | Fires on | Fix |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `URL_TOO_LONG` | notice | SF-derived | URL exceeds the configured length threshold | Shorten the URL while preserving a stable, descriptive path. |
| `URL_HAS_PARAMS` | notice | SF-derived | Parameterized URL has no canonical | Point the canonical to the preferred parameter-free URL when the parameters do not create unique indexable content. |
| `URL_NON_ASCII` | notice | SF-derived | URL contains non-ASCII characters | Consider a consistent ASCII transliteration for human-readable URLs where appropriate. |
| `URL_UPPERCASE` | notice | SF-derived | URL path contains uppercase characters | Normalize the path to lowercase and add a 301 redirect from the uppercase variant. |
| `DEEP_CRAWL_DEPTH` | warning | SF-derived | Page has excessive crawl depth | Use relevant internal links to make the page reachable in fewer clicks from the home page or an authoritative hub. |
| `ORPHAN_PAGE` | warning | SF-derived | Orphan page has no internal inlinks | Add relevant internal links so users and crawlers can discover the page. |
| `SLOW_RESPONSE` | warning | SF-derived | Slow server response | Improve TTFB by profiling the application and origin, then optimizing caching and infrastructure. |
| `LARGE_HTML` | warning | SF-derived+heuristic | HTML document is large in absolute terms or relative to the site | Reduce HTML size by removing unnecessary markup, extracting inline styles or scripts, and avoiding embedded base64 assets. |

## 7.J — security

| Check id | Severity | Evidence | Fires on | Fix |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `HTTP_URL` | warning | SF-derived | URL uses HTTP instead of HTTPS | Serve the URL over HTTPS and redirect the HTTP version with a 301. |

## 7.K — sitemap & robots

| Check id | Severity | Evidence | Fires on | Fix |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `SITEMAP_NOT_IN_ROBOTS` | notice | sitemap | robots.txt does not declare a Sitemap directive | Add a Sitemap directive to robots.txt with the absolute sitemap URL. |
| `SITEMAP_URL_3XX` | warning | sitemap | Sitemap URL returns a 3xx response | List the final 200-status URL in the sitemap instead of a redirecting URL. |
| `SITEMAP_URL_4XX_5XX` | critical | sitemap | Sitemap URL returns a 4xx or 5xx response | Remove broken URLs from the sitemap or restore them before listing them again. |
| `SITEMAP_URL_NON_INDEXABLE` | warning | sitemap | Sitemap contains a non-indexable URL | Keep only canonical, indexable URLs in the sitemap. |
| `SITEMAP_ORPHAN` | warning | sitemap | Sitemap URL has no internal inlinks | Add relevant internal links to the page or remove it from the sitemap if it should not be discoverable. |
| `URL_NOT_IN_SITEMAP` | notice | sitemap | Indexable page is missing from the sitemap | Add the canonical page URL to the appropriate sitemap. |
| `SITEMAP_STALE_LASTMOD` | notice | sitemap | Sitemap contains stale or boilerplate lastmod values | Generate each lastmod value from the page's actual meaningful modification date. |
| `SITEMAP_TOO_MANY_URLS` | warning | sitemap | Sitemap declares more URLs than the protocol allows | Split the sitemap into files of at most 50,000 URLs each and list them in a sitemap index. Over the limit the file is invalid and a search engine may read part of it and discard the rest without reporting anything. |
| `SITEMAP_TOO_LARGE` | warning | sitemap | Sitemap exceeds the protocol's uncompressed size limit | Split the sitemap so each file stays under 50 MB uncompressed. The limit is about the document a search engine parses, so compressing it does not help. |
| `SITEMAP_URL_DUPLICATED` | notice | sitemap | URL is declared in more than one sitemap | Declare each URL in exactly one sitemap. A URL in two files is usually a generator that ran twice, and it distorts every count taken from the declared set. |
| `SITEMAP_DESYNC` | warning | sitemap | Sitemap and crawl URL sets are out of sync | Synchronize the sitemap with the site's actual set of canonical, indexable pages. |
| `SITEMAP_FETCH_INCOMPLETE` | notice | sitemap | Some child sitemaps could not be fetched or parsed | Check that every child sitemap is reachable, retry in case the service was temporarily slow, and validate the XML -- a 200 response with malformed markup (e.g. an unescaped '&' in a URL) fails here the same way a network error does. |

## 8.x — heuristics beyond SF

| Check id | Severity | Evidence | Fires on | Fix |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `HTML_BLOAT` | notice | heuristic | HTML bloat: high document size relative to text content | Reduce bytes per word by extracting styles and scripts, removing embedded base64 assets, and simplifying markup. |
| `DOM_TOO_DEEP` | notice | heuristic | DOM nesting is too deep | Simplify the layout hierarchy and remove unnecessary wrapper elements. |
| `DOM_TOO_MANY_NODES` | notice | heuristic | DOM contains too many nodes | Reduce the number of page elements and avoid rendering unnecessary or duplicated components. |
| `TITLE_TEMPLATED` | notice | heuristic | Templated titles share a common prefix or suffix across most pages | Make the page-specific portion of each title distinctive; a shared brand suffix is acceptable, but duplicated core title text is not. |

## --- extension: URL hygiene ---

| Check id | Severity | Evidence | Fires on | Fix |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `URL_UNDERSCORES` | notice | SF:URL:Underscores | URL contains underscores | Use hyphens instead of underscores in URL path segments. |
| `URL_MULTIPLE_SLASHES` | notice | SF:URL:Multiple Slashes | URL path contains repeated slashes | Remove duplicate slashes and 301-redirect the malformed variant to the canonical path. |
| `URL_CONTAINS_SPACE` | warning | SF:URL:Contains Space | URL contains a space | Remove literal spaces and %20 sequences from the canonical URL structure. |
| `URL_REPETITIVE_PATH` | notice | SF:URL:Repetitive Path | URL path contains a repeated segment | Simplify the URL structure so path segments are not duplicated. |
| `URL_TRACKING_PARAMS` | warning | SF-derived | Indexable URL contains a tracking parameter such as utm_, gclid, or fbclid | Remove tracking parameters from public links; for parameterized URLs that still receive traffic, add a self-referencing canonical or manage crawling through robots.txt and Search Console as appropriate. |

## --- extension: content and readability ---

| Check id | Severity | Evidence | Fires on | Fix |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `READABILITY_DIFFICULT` | notice | SF-derived | Text is difficult to read (low Flesch score) | Use clearer wording and shorter sentences while preserving technical accuracy. |
| `LONG_SENTENCES` | notice | SF-derived | Average sentence length is too high | Break long sentences into shorter, focused statements. |
| `SPELLING_ERRORS` | notice | SF:Content:Spelling Errors | Spelling errors detected | Review and correct spelling errors, accounting for valid product names and specialist terminology. |
| `GRAMMAR_ERRORS` | notice | SF:Content:Grammar Errors | Grammar errors detected | Review and correct the flagged grammar issues in their full sentence context. |

## --- extension: robots directives ---

| Check id | Severity | Evidence | Fires on | Fix |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `NOARCHIVE` | notice | SF:Directives:NoArchive | Page contains a noarchive directive | Confirm that preventing cached search-result copies is intentional. |
| `NOSNIPPET` | notice | SF:Directives:NoSnippet | Page contains a nosnippet directive | Confirm that suppressing the page's search-result snippet is intentional. |
| `NOIMAGEINDEX` | notice | SF:Directives:NoImageIndex | Page contains a noimageindex directive | Confirm that preventing images on this page from being indexed is intentional. |
| `META_REFRESH_REDIRECT` | warning | SF:Directives:Refresh | Redirect is implemented with meta refresh | Replace meta refresh with a server-side 301 redirect when the move is permanent. |
| `HTTP_REFRESH_REDIRECT` | warning | crawl:http_refresh | Redirect is implemented with an HTTP Refresh response header | Replace it with a server-side 301/302 redirect (Location header); a search engine treats Refresh the same as a meta refresh -- an unreliable, delayed signal compared to a real HTTP redirect status code. |
| `NOTRANSLATE` | notice | SF-derived | Page contains a notranslate directive | Confirm that blocking the browser's offer-to-translate prompt is intentional. |
| `UNAVAILABLE_AFTER` | warning | SF-derived | Page carries an unavailable_after directive with a deindex date | Confirm the date is intentional and in the future; once it passes, the page is removed from the index automatically. |

## --- extension: canonicals ---

| Check id | Severity | Evidence | Fires on | Fix |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `CANONICAL_RELATIVE` | notice | SF:Canonicals:Canonical Is Relative | Canonical URL is relative | Use an absolute URL in the canonical element. |
| `CANONICAL_MULTIPLE` | warning | SF:Canonicals:Multiple | Page declares multiple canonical URLs | Declare exactly one canonical URL for the page. |
| `CANONICAL_FRAGMENT` | notice | SF-derived | Canonical URL contains a #fragment | Drop the fragment; the server never receives it, so a canonical pointing at one is meaningless. |

## --- extension: canonical graph (Mode B, built from Internal:All) ---

| Check id | Severity | Evidence | Fires on | Fix |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `CANONICAL_CHAIN` | warning | SF-derived | Canonical chain: the target canonicalizes to another URL (two or more steps) | Point the canonical directly to the final canonical URL in one step and break any canonical loops. |
| `CANONICAL_TO_REDIRECT` | warning | SF-derived | Canonical points to a redirecting URL (3xx) | Point the canonical to the final 200-status URL; otherwise search engines must resolve conflicting canonical signals. |
| `UNLINKED_CANONICAL` | warning | SF-derived | Canonical target has no hyperlink pointing to it anywhere in the crawl | Add an ordinary internal link to the canonical target, or confirm relying on the canonical alone for discovery is intentional. |
| `HREFLANG_BROKEN_TARGET` | warning | inlinks:All Hreflang | Hreflang points to a redirecting or broken URL (3xx, 4xx, or 5xx) | Update hreflang to reference the final 200-status URL; redirecting or broken targets undermine localization signals and crawling. |
| `HREFLANG_INVALID_CODE` | warning | inlinks:All Hreflang | Hreflang value is not a valid ISO 639-1 language / ISO 3166-1 region code | Use a valid language code, optionally followed by a valid region (e.g. en-GB, not en-UK). |
| `HREFLANG_MULTIPLE_ENTRIES` | warning | inlinks:All Hreflang | The same hreflang value is declared more than once on the page | Declare each language/region combination exactly once; conflicting duplicates make the annotation ambiguous. |
| `HREFLANG_MISSING_SELF_REFERENCE` | warning | inlinks:All Hreflang | Page declares hreflang alternates but does not reference itself | Every page in an hreflang set must include a self-referencing annotation for its own URL and language. |
| `HREFLANG_MISSING_XDEFAULT` | notice | inlinks:All Hreflang | Hreflang set has no x-default fallback | Add an x-default annotation to catch users whose language/region does not match any declared alternate. |
| `HREFLANG_NOT_CANONICAL` | warning | inlinks:All Hreflang | Hreflang points to a URL that is not itself the canonical version | Point hreflang annotations at each target's canonical URL, not at a duplicate that canonicalizes elsewhere. |
| `HREFLANG_MISSING_RETURN_LINK` | warning | inlinks:All Hreflang | Another page's hreflang points here, but this page does not point back | Add a reciprocal hreflang annotation back to every page that names this one. |

## --- extension: pagination ---

| Check id | Severity | Evidence | Fires on | Fix |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `PAGINATION_NONINDEXABLE` | warning | SF-derived | Pagination page is non-indexable | Pagination pages should generally remain crawlable and indexable unless a deliberate alternative architecture is in place. |
| `PAGINATION_LOOP` | warning | SF-derived | A rel="next" pagination series loops back on itself | Fix the rel="next"/rel="prev" values so the series terminates instead of cycling. |
| `UNLINKED_PAGINATION_SERIES` | warning | SF-derived | A pagination series is reachable only by following rel="next", never by a hyperlink | Add an ordinary internal link to the first page of the series so it does not depend on rel="next" alone for discovery. |
| `PAGINATION_MULTIPLE` | warning | inlinks:All Inlinks | The page declares more than one rel="next" (or more than one rel="prev") URL | Declare exactly one rel="next" and one rel="prev" URL per page; two different successors leave the series ambiguous, and a crawler picks one of them without telling anybody which. |
| `PAGINATION_URL_NOT_IN_ANCHOR` | notice | inlinks:All Inlinks | A rel="next"/rel="prev" URL is not also linked from the same page with an anchor | Link the paginated URL from the page itself with an ordinary <a href> as well. Google stopped using rel="next"/rel="prev" for indexing in 2019, so an annotation with no anchor beside it is a route only some crawlers still take. |
| `PAGINATION_SEQUENCE_ERROR` | warning | SF-derived | A rel="next" series breaks a page-number run it otherwise follows | Point each rel="next" at the page that actually follows this one. A run that goes 1, 2, 3, 7 leaves pages 4 to 6 out of the chain entirely, so a crawler following it never reaches them. |

## --- extension: links ---

| Check id | Severity | Evidence | Fires on | Fix |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `NO_INTERNAL_OUTLINKS` | warning | SF:Links:Pages Without Internal Outlinks | Dead-end page has no internal outlinks | Add relevant internal links to help users and crawlers continue through the site. |
| `HIGH_EXTERNAL_OUTLINKS` | notice | SF:Links:Pages With High External Outlinks | Page has a high number of external outlinks | Review the links for editorial relevance, spam, and unnecessary dilution of page focus. |
| `HIGH_OUTLINKS` | notice | SF:Links:Pages With High Outlinks | Page has an excessive number of outlinks | Reduce unnecessary links to preserve clear navigation and crawl focus. |
| `GENERIC_ANCHOR_TEXT` | notice | inlinks:Anchor Text | Non-descriptive anchor text such as 'here', 'read more', or 'click here' | Replace it with meaningful anchor text that describes the destination for both search engines and screen-reader users. |
| `LOW_LINK_SCORE` | notice | inlinks:All Inlinks | Internal link score is far below the site median | Add internal, followed links to the page from well-linked pages elsewhere on the site. |
| `ONLY_NOFOLLOW_INLINKS` | warning | inlinks:All Inlinks | Every internal link to this page is nofollow | Add at least one ordinary, followed internal link so link equity and crawl priority reach the page. |
| `ONLY_NONINDEXABLE_SOURCE_INLINKS` | warning | inlinks:All Inlinks | Every internal link to this page comes from a non-indexable source | Link to the page from at least one indexable page so it is reachable from the part of the site search engines actually rank. |
| `DEEP_DISCOVERY_PATH` | notice | inlinks:All Inlinks | The shortest hyperlink route from the start page exceeds the configured depth | Add a shorter internal-linking route (e.g. from a hub or category page) so the page is reachable in fewer clicks. |
| `INSECURE_SUBRESOURCE` | warning | inlinks:All Inlinks | An HTTPS page loads a resource (image, script, stylesheet, ...) over plain HTTP | Serve every page resource over HTTPS and update its URL accordingly. |

## --- extension: technical checks ---

| Check id | Severity | Evidence | Fires on | Fix |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `HTTP1_ONLY` | notice | SF-derived | Response uses HTTP/1.x rather than HTTP/2 or newer | Enable HTTP/2 or HTTP/3 on the origin server or CDN where supported. |
| `AMPHTML_PRESENT` | notice | SF-derived | AMP version is declared | Confirm that the AMP version is still required, current, valid, and canonically linked. |

## snapshot of every id Lighthouse actually defines.

| Check id | Severity | Evidence | Fires on | Fix |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `MISSING_CHARSET` | warning | SF-derived | No character encoding declared via Content-Type or an early <meta> tag | Declare charset in the Content-Type response header, or add a <meta charset> tag in the first 1024 bytes of the HTML. |
| `MISSING_DOCTYPE` | notice | SF-derived | Document lacks a modern <!DOCTYPE html> declaration, triggering quirks mode | Add `<!DOCTYPE html>` as the very first line of the document, with no PUBLIC or SYSTEM identifier. |
| `VIEWPORT_MISSING` | warning | SF-derived | No <meta name=viewport> tag with width or an initial-scale of at least 1 | Add `<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1">` to the document head. |
| `UNSUPPORTED_PLUGIN` | warning | crawl:plugin_elements | Page contains a legacy plugin-dependent element (<object>/<embed>/<applet>) | Replace the plugin-dependent element with a native equivalent (HTML5 <video>/<audio>, an <img>/<svg>, or a JavaScript-driven alternative) -- mobile browsers, and modern desktop ones, do not run plugins, so this content is simply invisible there. |
| `NO_COMPRESSION` | notice | SF-derived | HTML response is served uncompressed above the size where gzip/br would help | Enable gzip, Brotli, or deflate compression for text responses on the origin server or CDN. |

## --- extension: element position & document skeleton (issue #123) ---

| Check id | Severity | Evidence | Fires on | Fix |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `TITLE_OUTSIDE_HEAD` | warning | SF-derived | The <title> element is outside <head> once the parser resolves the document | Move whatever precedes it in <head> — usually an element the head content model does not allow — so <title> is read from <head> again. |
| `DESC_OUTSIDE_HEAD` | warning | SF-derived | The meta description is outside <head> once the parser resolves the document | Move whatever precedes it in <head> — usually an element the head content model does not allow — so the description is read from <head> again. |
| `CANONICAL_OUTSIDE_HEAD` | critical | SF-derived | The canonical link is outside <head> once the parser resolves the document | Move whatever precedes it in <head> — usually an element the head content model does not allow — so the canonical is read from <head> again; Google ignores a canonical outside <head>. |
| `DIRECTIVES_OUTSIDE_HEAD` | critical | SF-derived | A robots-directive meta tag is outside <head> once the parser resolves the document | Move whatever precedes it in <head> — usually an element the head content model does not allow — so the directive is read from <head> again; a noindex/nofollow outside <head> does not apply. |
| `HREFLANG_OUTSIDE_HEAD` | warning | SF-derived | An hreflang alternate link is outside <head> once the parser resolves the document | Move whatever precedes it in <head> — usually an element the head content model does not allow — so the alternate is read from <head> again. |
| `HEAD_MISSING` | warning | SF-derived | Document has no <head> element | Add a <head> element; a browser inserts one implicitly, but every metadata tag then depends on exactly where it lands. |
| `HEAD_MULTIPLE` | notice | SF-derived | Document has more than one <head> element | Merge into a single <head>; a browser keeps both as siblings rather than combining their contents. |
| `BODY_MISSING` | warning | SF-derived | Document has no <body> element | Add a <body> element; a browser inserts one implicitly around the visible content. |
| `BODY_MULTIPLE` | notice | SF-derived | Document has more than one <body> element | Merge into a single <body>; a browser keeps both as siblings rather than combining their contents. |
| `INVALID_HEAD_ELEMENT` | notice | SF-derived | An element the head content model does not allow is written inside <head> | Move title/base/link/meta/style/script/noscript/template content into <head> and everything else into <body>; an invalid element is what forces the parser to close <head> early. |
| `HEAD_NOT_FIRST` | notice | SF-derived | <head> is not the first element under <html> once the parser resolves the document | Fix the markup order so <head> opens immediately after <html>, before any <body> content. |

| Check id | Severity | Evidence | Fires on | Fix |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `MIXED_CONTENT` | warning | SF:Security:Mixed Content | Mixed content: HTTPS page loads resources over HTTP | Serve every page resource over HTTPS and update its URL accordingly. |
| `MISSING_HSTS` | notice | SF:Security:Missing HSTS Header | HSTS header is missing | Add an appropriate Strict-Transport-Security header after confirming the entire site is HTTPS-ready. |
| `STRUCTURED_DATA_MISSING` | notice | SF:Structured Data:Missing | Structured data is missing | Add relevant, accurate Schema.org markup that reflects visible page content. |
| `OG_MISSING` | notice | SF:Social:Open Graph | og:title is missing, so social previews may not render correctly | Add og:title, og:image, and og:url; at minimum, provide og:title and og:image for a useful preview. |
| `IMG_OVER_KB` | warning | SF:Images:Over X KB | Image exceeds the configured file-size threshold | Compress the image and consider converting it to WebP or AVIF while preserving acceptable visual quality. |
| `IMG_MISSING_DIMENSIONS` | notice | SF:Images:Missing Size Attributes | Image is missing width and height attributes | Declare intrinsic width and height values to reserve layout space and reduce CLS. |

|---|---|---|---|---|
| `INLINK_BOILERPLATE_ONLY` | warning | crawl:link_position | Page is linked only from navigation, header, sidebar, or footer, never from body content | Add a contextual link to the page from relevant body copy; a page reachable only through boilerplate is not linked the way a page in the content graph is. |

## nor a link's rel/target/raw-href.

| Check id | Severity | Evidence | Fires on | Fix |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `UNSAFE_CROSS_ORIGIN_LINK` | warning | crawl:link_findings | A target="_blank" link declares neither rel="noopener" nor rel="noreferrer" | Add rel="noopener" (or "noreferrer") so the opened page cannot reach back into this one through window.opener. |
| `PROTOCOL_RELATIVE_LINK` | notice | crawl:link_findings | Link href is written in the protocol-relative "//host/path" form | Write an explicit https:// href; a protocol-relative one silently follows whatever scheme served the current page, including a plain-HTTP embed. |
| `OUTLINK_TO_LOCALHOST` | warning | crawl:link_findings | A link points at a loopback address (localhost, 127.0.0.1, ::1, ...) | Replace the development/staging reference with the production URL. |
| `FOLLOW_AND_NOFOLLOW_INLINKS` | notice | crawl:link_findings | The page receives both a followed and a nofollow internal link | Decide deliberately whether the page should be crawl-priority or not, and make every internal link to it agree. |
| `FORM_URL_INSECURE` | critical | crawl:link_findings | A form submits to an http:// action, so its data leaves the browser unencrypted regardless of the page's own scheme | Point the form's action at an https:// URL. |
| `FORM_ON_HTTP_URL` | critical | crawl:link_findings | A form with a password field is served from a plain-HTTP page, so the credentials themselves travel unencrypted before the action URL is even reached | Serve the page itself over HTTPS; an HTTPS form action does not protect input typed on an HTTP page. |
