# Guideline: operating this toolkit

This is the document to read first. It is written for a person meeting the tool, in the order a
person meets it — not a reference, and not a recipe for a question you already know how to ask.

If you know what you want, the other three layers are faster:

| You want | Read |
|---|---|
| a chain, end to end | [scenarios/](scenarios/README.md) |
| one command's arguments | [TOOL_REFERENCE.md](TOOL_REFERENCE.md) |
| what a check means | [CHECKS.md](CHECKS.md) |
| what an agent should run | [.claude/skills/control/SKILL.md](../.claude/skills/control/SKILL.md) |
| a crawl that stopped early | [RECOVERY.md](RECOVERY.md) |

## 1. What this is, and what it is not

**It is a crawler and an analysis layer.** It fetches a site the way a search engine's crawler
would — one host, at a rate you choose, honouring robots.txt by default — records what came
back, and applies 155 checks to that evidence. Then a set of specialised tools answer questions
the crawl raised: does JavaScript change what a crawler sees, is the structured data a connected
graph, how heavy are the images really.

**It is not a rank tracker.** Nothing here knows what any page ranks for.

**It is not Search Console.** Nothing here knows whether a page is indexed, how often it is
shown, or what Google chose as its canonical. Reachability is not indexation, and the two are
confused constantly. If a page is reachable, indexable and in the sitemap, this tool will tell
you that and nothing more.

**It is not a judge of quality.** Every check is structural. "This page has 800 words in its
content region" is a measurement; "this page is worth reading" is not, and no output here should
be read as claiming it.

**It has no interface.** A CLI and a local MCP server, both over the same handlers. There is no
web panel and there will not be one.

The point of the whole thing is narrow and worth stating plainly: checking every page of a site
by hand gives the best analysis and costs the most; a script is cheap and usually stupid. This
repository exists to close that gap — to encode what a careful person would check by hand into
configs and scripts, test them against real sites, and get that quality at any number of pages.

## 2. Your first run

Install into a virtual environment and confirm it answers:

```bash
seohead --version
```

Then parse one page. Not a crawl — one page, so you can see the shape of everything before
committing to a site:

```bash
seohead parse --url https://example.com
```

That prints a JSON document: title, description, headings, canonical, robots directives,
Open Graph, JSON-LD, links, word count, and `content_area_strategy` — which region of the page
the word count came from. Read that field. It is the difference between counting a page and
counting a page plus its navigation.

Now crawl, into a directory:

```bash
seohead crawl-site --url https://example.com --out-dir ./run --max-urls 200
```

Two files land in `./run`:

- **`pages.jsonl`** — one line per fetched URL: status, content type, size in bytes, title,
  canonical, word count, how it was measured.
- **`audit.json`** — the run manifest, the summary, and the findings.

Everything else in this toolkit reads one of those two.

A third file, `crawl_state.json`, lands in the same directory as a checkpoint — invisible in a
run that finishes, and the whole story when one does not. If the process is interrupted partway
through, rerunning the identical command resumes from it instead of starting over. See
[RECOVERY.md](RECOVERY.md) for the exact requirement and how to tell a resume from an
intentional fresh start.

## 3. Choosing a rate, and whose fault the errors are

Decide this **before** the first request. A rate chosen after a host starts refusing is a rate
chosen by the host.

| Situation | Rate |
|---|---|
| Your own site, known capacity | 10–20 URL/s |
| Somebody else's site, no information | **3 URL/s** |
| A host that has already shown strain | 1 URL/s, or stop |

Set it in a config file rather than flags, because the config is the record of what was
measured:

```json
{"limits": {"max_urls": 5000, "max_depth": 20, "max_crawl_seconds": 5400},
 "speed":  {"min_delay_seconds": 0.333, "concurrency": 3, "adaptive": true},
 "robots": {"policy": "respect"}, "sitemaps": {"auto_discover": true}}
```

```bash
seohead crawl-site --url https://example.com --config ./crawl.json --out-dir ./run
```

### The lesson worth reading twice

A WordPress blog crawled at 10 URL/s started returning 502 after 249 pages, and the circuit
breaker stopped the run. The same six URLs, re-fetched one every three seconds with a browser
user agent, all answered 301 normally. **The 502s were caused by the crawl.** At 3 URL/s the
same site completed all 3387 URLs.

Two things follow. First, the breaker stopping is the tool working — treat it as a finding about
your rate, not about the site. Second, and worse: reporting "this host returns 502 under load"
as a site defect, when the load was yours, is the most embarrassing mistake an audit can make.

Before blaming a site for errors, re-fetch five of the failing URLs slowly. If they answer, the
failures were yours.

### Why latency, not status, is the signal

Measured on a shared-hosting catalogue: under a polite 1.5 URL/s the origin degraded from
1196 ms to 16455 ms and then began refusing TLS handshakes — **without ever returning an error
status.** A throttle that only widens on non-200 responses would have kept pushing all the way
down. That is why the delay here widens on latency and hard on a timeout, and why concurrency
collapses to one at the first refusal.

## 4. Reading `audit.json` without being misled

The most expensive mistake is reading the findings first. A list of problems from a run that
covered a third of the site, with a third of the checks, looks exactly like a list from a
complete one.

**Read these four fields, in this order:**

| Field | What it tells you |
|---|---|
| `run.crawl_finish_reason` | `finished`, or why not — `errors`, `budget`, `duration` |
| `run.crawl_partial` | whether the crawl covered the site |
| `summary.check_coverage` | how many checks *could* run |
| `summary.health_score_basis` | whether the score compares to anything |

Four words mean four different things and are constantly confused:

- **fired** — the check ran and found something.
- **skipped** — the check *could not run*, and the reason is named: a missing export column, a
  page property nobody recorded. This is not "zero issues".
- **disabled** — the operator turned the check off in config (`checks.<ID>.enabled: false`).
  Named separately from `skipped` so a deliberate switch is never read as missing evidence, and
  named at all so it is never read as `silent`.
- **silent** — the check *was invoked* and found nothing. This is the good one. `checks_silent_ids`
  names the population; a check no code path ever calls is a defect, not a silent one.

A health score computed from 16 of 155 checks is not a health score. The audit says so in
`health_score_basis`, and where coverage is too low the score is withheld rather than averaged
out of whatever happened to be available. **Report that sentence next to the score, always.**

**Then look at the shape before the list:**

```python
sorted(summary["by_check"].items(), key=lambda kv: -kv[1])[:10]
```

A check that fired on more than half the pages is almost always wrong — the tool exists to find
the *unusual*. On one live 124-page site, one check produced 392 of 529 findings: 74% of the
report, and every one false. That was visible in one line, before reading a single URL.

The report now says it for you. Any check covering more than half the crawled pages is listed
under **"Look at these before trusting the rest"**, above the findings rather than in an
appendix, and the same list is in `audit.json` as `summary.implausible_checks`. It is not a
failure: a site really may have no meta description anywhere. It is the one minute of checking
that would have caught all three of the defects live crawls found (#94, #95, #96).

**And scan the run:**

```bash
seohead log-scan --run ./run
```

Nine rules, each written from a defect that shipped past the whole test suite. Exit 2 means
two numbers in the same run disagree with each other. Beside them, under `review`, sit the
checks that describe most of the site: not a contradiction, since a uniform site makes them
true, so they never change the exit code -- only ask for a minute of your attention. Twenty seconds here is cheaper than a
client asking why a 739 KB file is listed as 1.27 MB.

---

## 5. The config file: what changes findings, what changes only cost

```bash
seohead crawl-site --config-help
```

That prints every setting: dotted path, type, default, description, and whether it is
**results-affecting**. The distinction is the whole reason the file exists.

- **Results-affecting** settings change *what is found*: scope, robots policy, rendering mode,
  content-area selectors, link-position classification. Every one of them is written into the
  run manifest inside `audit.json`, because two crawls that disagree are only comparable if you
  can see which settings produced each.
- **Cost settings** change only how long it takes and how hard the host is pushed: delay,
  concurrency, timeouts, budgets.

Change a results-affecting setting between two runs and the difference you measure is partly
your own configuration. That is the single most common way a "before and after" becomes
meaningless.

---

## 6. The mistakes everybody makes first

**Trusting a partial crawl.** `crawl_partial: true` means absence proves nothing. "Nothing links
to this page" is unprovable on a crawl that stopped early, which is why orphan findings are
withheld — named as skipped — rather than guessed at.

**Comparing two runs with different settings.** See section 5. Compare like with like, or you
are measuring your own edit.

**Reading a count without its population.** Every check describes a specific set. "Missing from
the sitemap" is about *indexable pages*; comparing it against every link destination reports
images, outbound links and URLs that were never fetched. That mistake produced the 392 findings
above. The sets are written down in
[.claude/skills/control/reference/populations.md](../.claude/skills/control/reference/populations.md).

**Believing a dominant check.** If one check is more than half your findings, stop trusting it
for this report, verify five of its hits by hand, and file the bug.

**Reporting your own rate limit as a site defect.** Section 3.

**Mixing rendered and static numbers.** `summary.totals.pages_by_representation` says how each
page was measured. A figure averaged across both was never measured the same way twice.

---

## 7. When the tool is wrong

It will be. Four defects were found on three live sites in a single afternoon — and all four
were in the *checks*, none in the traversal: every URL was fetched exactly once, redirects were
observed and not followed, off-host links were recorded and never requested, the breaker held.
The crawl was right; the conclusions drawn from it were not.

**A finding you cannot reproduce yourself is not a finding.** Every critical that goes into a
deliverable gets checked against the live URL first, slowly, with a browser user agent:

```bash
curl -s -o /dev/null -w '%{http_code} -> %{redirect_url}\n' -A 'Mozilla/5.0' https://example.com
```

Both outcomes are worth the time. The same step confirmed an entire twelve-page services section
really returning 404, and refuted 78 findings that claimed a canonical was a redirect when it
answered 200.

**When it is wrong, the output is an issue, not a workaround.** Attach the real page as a
fixture. Never a local patch, never a throwaway script that routes around the defect — a
workaround makes the next run wrong in the same way, and nobody remembers why.

An issue here is a specification: the symptom, the cause with a file and a line, what it
corrupts downstream, what is requested, and acceptance criteria. Then one commit, one pull
request, one issue closed.

---

## 8. What it cannot answer at all

Say these out loud in anything you hand over. A limit nobody states is a limit the reader
assumes away.

- **It measures the site as served, not as ranked.** No rankings, no traffic, no indexation, no
  competitors, no before-and-after attribution.
- **It measures structure, not quality.** Expertise, usefulness, tone and accuracy are yours to
  judge.
- **Lab numbers, not field data.** Timings come from one headless browser on one connection.
- **One host, unless told otherwise.** Off-host links are recorded and never fetched.
- **Static markup, unless rendering ran.** Check `pages_by_representation`.
- **It cannot fix a server.** An archive of optimized images is not a deploy; a security grade
  is not a hardened server.
- **It does not know what matters.** Severity is not priority: a critical on a page nobody
  visits ranks below a warning on the page that earns the money, and nothing here knows which
  is which.

---

## 9. Where to go next

- **[scenarios/](scenarios/README.md)** — chains end to end, each with its commands, its output,
  its cost and its limits. Start here once you know what you want.
- **[COVERAGE_SF_ISSUES.md](COVERAGE_SF_ISSUES.md)** — every issue in the field's published
  catalogue, and whether this toolkit finds it.
- **[.claude/skills/control/SKILL.md](../.claude/skills/control/SKILL.md)** — the same loop,
  written for an agent to follow.
- **[TESTING.md](TESTING.md)** — how the suite is run, and why chain tests exist beside unit
  tests.
