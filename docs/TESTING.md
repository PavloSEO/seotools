# Testing

## How to run

```bash
.venv/bin/pytest              # full suite, ~3 s
.venv/bin/pytest -q           # quieter
.venv/bin/pytest tests/test_recon.py -q          # one file
.venv/bin/pytest tests/test_rules.py -k thin -q  # one test by name
```

If the venv does not exist, see [SETUP.md](SETUP.md) — nothing is installed
by the tests themselves. The first public snapshot contained **458 offline tests**; the current
suite contains **over 1500 offline tests**. Runtime varies
with Python version and installed extras. CI (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`) runs the same suite on
Python 3.10, 3.12, and 3.13 plus the gates described below.

## The one rule: offline or it does not exist

No test goes to the network. Mocking is done with `monkeypatch`, fake
clients and fixtures — e.g. `test_data_sources.py` feeds `_FakeClient`
objects into the Arsenkin batch runner; `test_llms_txt.py` patches the HTTP
client factory. Verdict logic is deliberately factored into pure functions
(`compare()` in `tools/render.py`, `_findings()` in `recon/regions.py`,
`detect_bot()` in `tools/logs.py`) so tests never need a browser or a
socket.

Why: a suite that needs the internet goes green on the developer's machine,
falls apart on CI, and eventually nobody trusts it. The price is that the
thin network/browser wrappers themselves are only covered indirectly.

**A new recon or data-source tool without an offline test is not accepted**
(see [ARCHITECTURE.md](ARCHITECTURE.md)).

## What the suite covers

Grouped by area (file names under `tests/`):

- **SF audit core**: `test_loader.py` (export discovery/normalization),
  `test_rules.py`, `test_check_coverage.py`, `test_inlinks.py`,
  `test_heuristics.py`, `test_normalize.py`, `test_context.py`,
  `test_aggregate.py`, `test_sitemap_coverage.py`, `test_sitemap_txt.py` —
  the 139 checks over the synthetic crawl in `tests/fixtures/`.
- **Audit outputs**: `test_reporters.py` (audit.json validates against
  `sf/schema/audit.schema.json` — the contract test), `test_sf_config.py`
  (threshold/profile resolution), `test_tasks.py` (backlog building).
- **Mode A plumbing**: `test_sf_discovery.py`, `test_runner_throttle.py`
  (the generated `.seospiderconfig` rate limit), `test_url_sources.py`.
- **Live tools**: `test_tools_core.py` (parse/robots/redirects/…),
  `test_schema_org.py` + `test_schema_build.py` + `test_page_facts.py` +
  `test_page_type.py` (the Schema.org stack incl. the 1010-type
  vocabulary and the page classifier),
  `test_duplicate.py` (simhash + LSH), `test_logs.py`, `test_render.py`
  (raw-vs-DOM `compare()`), `test_soft404.py`, `test_social_meta.py`,
  `test_llms_txt.py`, `test_citability.py`.
- **Recon**: `test_recon.py` (normalization, date/whois parsing, CDN and
  tech signatures, security scoring), `test_tech_db.py` +
  `test_tech_categories.py` + `test_tech_coverage.py` (fingerprint
  database), `test_mirrors.py`, `test_ai_bots.py`, `test_regions.py`.
- **Bounded site audit & reports**: `test_site_audit.py` (the
  `seohead.site-audit/1` document assembly, severity rules, `tools_failed`
  semantics).
- **External data sources**: `test_data_sources.py` — credentials
  resolution, the spend journal, Arsenkin/Yandex/Metrika/DataForSEO
  clients against fakes, the DataForSEO geo guard.
- **Interface wiring**: `test_registration.py` (HANDLERS <-> CLI <-> MCP
  cross-check), `test_mcp.py` (starts a real stdio MCP server; skipped
  without the `mcp` package), `test_cli_stdin.py` (stdin handling,
  source-flag precedence).
- **Docs**: `test_docs_drift.py` — recounts tool/skill/check numbers in
  README, skills, and docs, and fails on references to
  non-existent commands. Documentation must rot loudly.
  `test_docs_commands_execute.py` goes one step further: it extracts every
  `seohead ...` invocation actually shown in README/docs/skills/examples
  (`scripts/doc_commands.py`) and runs each one for real against a loopback
  fixture site and copies of `examples/` — a renamed or removed flag fails
  here even if no other test happens to exercise it. The handful that need
  real infrastructure (RDAP/DNS, a licensed SF binary, a paid provider
  credential, the never-returning `mcp` server) are at least parsed against
  the live argument parser instead.
- **Safety nets**: `test_public_safety.py` covers private-network URL
  blocking and image mutation safeguards.

## CI gates beyond pytest

From `.github/workflows/ci.yml` (all run on every push/PR to `main`):

1. **Layer boundary**: a grep that fails if `seohead/sf|tools|recon|data_sources`
   imports `seohead.servers` or `seohead.cli`.
2. **Audit on examples**: `seohead sf run --exports-dir examples/exports`
   must produce issues — the sample crawl must keep finding its planted
   problems.
3. **Faces come up**: `seohead --version`, `sf-analyzer --version`, and the
   MCP server must build and list tools (asserts `seo_parse`,
   `seo_domain_profile`, `sf_audit_run` among them).

## What is deliberately not covered, and why

- **Real network behaviour of paid APIs** (Arsenkin, Yandex Cloud,
  Metrika, DataForSEO): clients are tested against fakes with representative response shapes.
  Live paid calls are deliberately excluded from the offline suite; DataForSEO defaults to its
  sandbox so integration checks can be performed without an accidental production charge.
- **The browser itself**: Playwright runs are not part of the suite;
  `render-check` is covered at the `compare()` level. `playwright` is not
  even installed in CI.
- **A real SF CLI crawl (mode A)**: only the generated config and discovery
  logic are tested; launching Screaming Frog requires a license.
- **CLI flag -> kwarg mapping for every command**: covered for stdin
  behaviour and spot-checked; there is no exhaustive per-command flag test.

## Missing tests, in the order they should be written

Descriptions only — write them when the corresponding code changes or
before extending that area.

1. **Per-command CLI smoke** (`seohead <cmd> --help` for all 45): the
   cheapest possible net against argument-parser typos — the exact class of
   the `soft-404-check` bug that once left a tool dead with tests green.
   `test_docs_commands_execute.py` now covers this for every command that
   happens to appear in a documented example; this item is the remainder —
   every command, whether or not any doc shows it.
2. **Flag-mapping test**: for each command in `COMMANDS`, assert that the
   flags added in `_add_flags` survive `_build_kwargs` into handler kwargs.
   Today a flag that is silently dropped is invisible to the suite.
3. **DataForSEO sandbox integration test** (marked network, skipped by
   default): one real sandbox call per tool to verify shapes against the
   fake-based tests once an account exists.
4. **`report-build` over `examples/reports/full.json` in every format**:
   the generators compute nothing, and a test should pin that property
   (same numbers in xlsx/docx/csv as in the source JSON).
5. **Spend-journal ordering**: an explicit test that `spend.record()` is called before response
   parsing in every paid handler; the invariant is documented in `AGENTS.md` and currently pinned
   most directly for Arsenkin.

## Fixtures

`tests/fixtures/` — a synthetic site export set with deliberate problems
(broken links, duplicates, thin content, sitemap desync). `conftest.py`
copies it into a temp dir per test (`exports_dir` fixture) and exposes a
ready `result` fixture that runs the full audit. Never edit fixtures to
make a check pass — the fixture is the ground truth the CI gate audits
against.

`tests/doc_fixtures/` — a small static site (`site/`) plus a loopback
`ThreadingHTTPServer` (`site_server.py`) that serves it, used only by
`test_docs_commands_execute.py` so live-URL commands from the docs have
something local and offline to point at.
